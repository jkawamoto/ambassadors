Yet another [Ambassador pattern](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/ambassador_pattern_linking/) over SSH.

Install
--------
You can pull a built container.

```sh
$ docker pull jkawamoto/ambassadors
```

If you are running on Raspberry Pi, you can pull it instead.

```sh
$ docker pull jkawamoto/rpi-ambassadors
```


Usage
-------
~~~sh
$ docker run -dt jkawamoto/ambassadors (server|client|tunnel) [-v]

Options:
  -v           Verbose mode for debugging.
~~~

AmbassadorS has three modes; server, client, and tunnel.
Those modes are associated as follows.

~~~
(a container) ---> (AmbassadorS client) ---> (AmbassadorS tunnel)
              == ssh ==> (AmbassadorS server) ---> (service containers)
~~~

You need one server-mode container on a host which has containers to be linked, i.e. *service containers*,
and one tunnel-mode container on each "client" host.
You also need client-mode containers for every linking container.


Example
--------
Suppose you have MySQL and MongoDB containers on host *A*, and a container on host *B* wants to link them,
you firstly need to run a server-mode container linking the MySQL and MongoDB containers on host *A*.

```sh
$ docker run -d --name ambassadors_server \
             -v ~/.ssh/:/data/ -p 10022:22 \
             --link mongo:mongo --link mysql:mysql \
             jkawamoto/ambassadors server
```

The server-mode container requires `authorized_keys` in `/data/` and to expose port `22` for sshd.
In this example, `authorized_keys` of host *A* will be used from the server-mode container.
The server-mode container also needs to link service containers.
In this case, it links to containers named mongo and mysql.

On host *B*, you need to run a tunnel-mode container.

```sh
$ docker run -dt --name ambassadors_tunnel \
            -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh -e PORT=10022 -e HOST=<host a> \
            jkawamoto/ambassadors tunnel
```

The environment variable `HOST` is the address for host *A* and `PORT` is specified the port number of sshd.
The tunnel-mode container requires a private key of which the related public key `id_rsa` is included in the `authorized_keys` put on the server-mode container.
The private key needs to be put in `/root/.ssh`.
In this example, `id_rsa` of host *B* will be used from the tunnel-mode container.

You also need to run client-mode containers for MySQL and MongoDB.

```sh
$ docker run -d --name mysql_ambassadors \
             --link ambassadors_tunnel:tunnel --expose 3306 -e PORT=3306 \
             jkawamoto/ambassadors client
$ docker run -d --name mongo_ambassadors \
             --link ambassadors_tunnel:tunnel --expose 27017 -e PORT=27017 \
             jkawamoto/ambassadors client
```

Those client-mode containers must link the tunnel-mode container with name `tunnel` and expose as same port as service containers expose.
In this case, the client-mode container for MySQL exposes `3306` while the mysql container exposes `3306`.
Those client-mode containers also need to set environment variable `PORT` as the exposed port number.

Finally, you can use MySQL and MongoDB running on host *A* from host *B*.

```sh
$ docker run -d --link mysql_ambassadors:mysql --link mongo_ambassadors:mongo some-app
```
